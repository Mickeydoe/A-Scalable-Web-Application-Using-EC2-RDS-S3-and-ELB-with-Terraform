Project: Scalable Web Application Using EC2, RDS, S3, and ELB
Overview:
This project involves setting up a scalable web application architecture using core AWS services. You'll create a secure and robust environment that leverages EC2 for compute power, RDS for relational database storage, S3 for static file storage, and an Elastic Load Balancer to distribute traffic evenly. Additionally, we will create a simple web application that interacts with the RDS database.

Components:

EC2 Instances: Deploy multiple EC2 instances to host the web application.
RDS (Relational Database Service): Use RDS for database storage, choosing a suitable engine like MySQL or PostgreSQL.
S3 Buckets: Store static files such as images, CSS, and JavaScript in S3.
Elastic Load Balancer (ELB): Distribute incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances to ensure high availability.
Security Groups (SGs): Secure the network traffic by configuring security groups to control inbound and outbound traffic.
